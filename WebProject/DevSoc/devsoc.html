    <h3>Python Workshop 1.0 and 2.0 - 4 hours CPD</h3>
    <img src="PythonWorkshop1.0.png" align="center" width="100%">
    <p>I have found DevSoc to be one of the most active societies at NTU.</p> <p>They proved really helpful and active on their Discord server, lots of events and lots of help to first year students in their dedicated channel.</p>
    <p>The only downside is that they can't offer more than 10 CPD hours, because they sure offered more than that plus pointing me in the direction of more online learning.</p> <p>Their Python Workshops, 1.0 and 2.0 provided very good information and the possibility to ask questions and get clear and concise answers.</p>
    <p>In short I think I have found a platform in which to pass on the information I gathered in this first year and pass it on to next year's first years.</p>
    <h3>Master the Mainframe Workshop - 2 hours CPD</h3>
    <img src="../Digital%20Horizons/MTM.png" align="center" width="100%">
    <p>The workshop was a great resource for getting started with the IBM Master the Mainframe challenges available until January.
    </p>
    <p>Help was offered with installing the required software VSCode, NodeJS and Java as well as setting up with ZOWE and IBM OpenZ Editor.</p>
    <h3>Introduction to Cybercrime with Adrian Winckles - 2 hours CPD</h3>
    <img src="CyberCrimeAW.png" align="center" width="100%">
    <p>The workshop was a wonderful overview of the Cyber Crime terms and legislation. It covered some of the techniques used by criminals and the law enforcement institutions that investigate such crimes
    </p>
    <p>The Q and A also provided some insight into whether or not to pursue a career with law enforcement Cyber Crime Units after completing the studies.</p>
